- **2) The work and span are both O(n+m).

- **4) The worst case is one time. In a connected graph, every node is reachable from every other node. So we only need to call it once, then compare the set of reachable nodes against the set of all nodes. If they are different, then there are unconnected nodes.

- **5) The work and span are both O(n+m), it is dominated by the call to reachable.

- **7) Yes, the work would become O(n^2).
